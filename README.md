Verify that the user can use all filters on Casio watches- even if the selected watch was searched or accessed by main Casio filter in the main list of products

**(inserati aici o concluzie generala a testarii care sa cuprinda cate teste au fost create si executate, ce procentaj aproximativ din cerintele in scop au fost acoperite, daca exista vreo functionalitate pe care nu ai apucat sa o testezi, daca bug-urile gasite impacteaza lansarea produsului in productie sau se pot fixa si ulterior, daca ai identificat riscuri de produs care trebuie mitigate, daca e vreo reecomandare pe care vrei sa o faci pentru lansare, daca sunt ceva lessons learned de care trebuie sa se tina cont la proiectele viitoare etc.)**
